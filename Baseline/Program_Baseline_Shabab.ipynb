Yes,\\\" said Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch, commenting on 1996 oil production figures.The State Statistics Committee said Russia's 1996 crude oil output fell two percent on 1995 levels to 293 million tonnes (around 5.86 million barrels per day).That is Russia's lowest crude oil output rate in nearly three decades.But the decline is the smallest since Russia -- still the world's third-largest oil producer -- discovered its huge West Siberian reserves and pushed oil output to a peak 570 million tonnes (11.4 million bpd) in 1987.The story has been a downhill one ever since, and double-digit percentage output declines throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s have left Russia's 1996 output at a meagre 51 percent of 1987's record level.But the picture, as the 1996 data shows, is getting prettier.\\\"The fall is finally coming to an end,\\\" said Stephen O'Sullivan, associate director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London. \\\"It's not just a flash in the pan like LUKoil -- it's clearly more broad-based.\\\"Analysts say the recovery showed its first real signs in the second quarter of 1996, possibly as Russian producers began to cash in on a world oil price rally and jammed export outlets.But not all analysts were as sanguine about 1996's results.\\\"The fact that it almost levelled out this year is significant,\\\" said a U.S. oil executive involved in the Petroleum Advisory Forum, a Moscow lobby of foreign oil majors.\\\"But I don't really think it means a whole lot, because there's a problem with domestic demand and with export capacity. It doesn't make sense for producers to produce as much as they can right now.\\\"Russia's oil firms have limited export options and other domestic industries are recovering more slowly.Russian gross domestic product fell by six percent in 1996 and industrial output shrank in every sector of the economy to plunge five percent overall, official figures showed.Declining domestic demand spurred Russian exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States to rise by five percent in the first 11 months of 1996 to 92.8 million tonnes.But analysts say Russia's increasingly hungry tax-man has eaten up a large portion of the extra export earnings, leaving Russia's newly-privatised companies with little to reinvest.Still, the export boom has spurred Russia's 13 or so vertically-integrated oil companies' appetite for growth, and both Lubash and O'Sullivan said domestic crude oil demand might pick up slightly next year.\\\"Any arrest in decline must be heartening and what we must be looking to see is some growth,\\\" said Martin Cocker, a partner in Ernst &amp; Young's World Energy Group unit in Moscow.But Russia's oil companies, most heading into their third or fourth years as restructured, privatised companies, will have problems in breaking completely free of Russia's economic woes.\\\"It's all a function of when domestic industry turns around,\\\" said the U.S. executive. \\\"Producers and refiners both have an incentive to export and will for quite some time.\\\"\",\n          \"Eli Lilly &amp; Co expects marketing and administration costs in the fourth quarter to be only slightly up or flat versus the year-ago level, marking a slowdown from a third-quarter jump of 6.5 percent.The line item \\\"may be up a couple percent, but certainly below the growth rates we showed in the third quarter,\\\" Lilly chief financial officer Charles Golden said in an interview.Lilly's gross profit margin declined again in the third quarter, partly due to increased marketing costs for launching new products, such as the anti-schizophrenia drug Zyprexa.  Zyprexa is one of a handful of new, higher-margin products that will begin to lift sales in the fourth quarter, but a margin trend turnaround is likely further off, Golden said.\\\"I think it's going to be sometime next year. I'm not sure it's in the next quarter,\\\" Golden said of improved margins.Gross margin has declined for two consecutive quarters.Other than that, analysts greeted Lilly's third-quarter results with a positive tone.\\\"I didn't see any real big surprises in these numbers,\\\" said NatWest Securities drug industry analyst John Lamberton.  Lilly's third-quarter operating profits of $0.64 per share, versus $0.54 per share in 1995, were precisely in line with Wall Street expectations, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Mariola Haggar.The company said an 11-percent sales gain was led by the anti-depressant Prozac, the human insulin Humulin and increased revenues from the PCS Health Systems unit.Shares in Lilly were up 1/2 to 69-1/4 on Tuesday after the Indianapolis-based drugmaker reported an 18-percent gain in third-quarter earnings over the year-ago period.  In the fourth quarter, Golden said, Lilly will likely lose a small benefit to earnings per share stemming from a decline in outstanding shares versus the prior year. That benefit, caused by the split-off of Guidant Corp last year, boosted third-quarter earnings by five percent.\\\"We will lose that in the fourth quarter ... You're talking a penny or two per share,\\\" he said.In the fourth quarter, the company will also lose a small boost to earnings from a lower tax rate that lifted third-quarter earnings slightly compared with the prior year.--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787\",\n          \"Merchant banking and Madame Tussaud's could be deemed surplus to requirements as a new management team at Britain's Pearson Plc mould a media company for the next millennium, analysts said on Wednesday.The Pearson empire contains prize brands such as the Financial Times newspaper and Penguin books but Marjorie Scardino, who will take over as chief executive in January, has said that overall profit performance is inadequate.Analysts say Pearson has yet to complete its 1990s journey from industrial conglomerate to focused media enterprise.  \\\"The definition of their three core business areas -- Information, Education and Entertainment is a little imprecise,\\\" said Mark Beilby of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. \\\"They may have to jettison some high value assets and focus on pinpoint areas.\\\"Analysts cite Anglo-Dutch company Reed Elsevier as an example of a media company which has successfully identified key market areas and built up strong positions in these -- the provision of high-margin business information being Reed's speciality.  They point out that Pearson, with a market capitalisation of around four billion stg, is not a media giant in global terms and that its capital and management time is being too thinly spread under the current structure.Pearson's 50 percent stake in London investment bank Lazard Brothers -- which does not fit into one of the three core business areas -- is seen as a likely candidate for disposal.\\\"At some stage Lazards will go out of the door to make Pearson into more of a genuine media company,\\\" said Louise Barton of Henderson Crosthwaite.  Close boardroom links between Pearson and Lazards could complicate matters. However, analysts say a sale would go a long way towards convincing doubters that Scardino is prepared to shake up the company.The Tussauds Group, which includes London's famous Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum and a number of theme parks, is also seen as peripheral and a drain on resources for a company which could earn richer pickings from television and publishing.U.S. consumer software publisher Mindscape is the most glaring weakness, with Pearson forecasting a 46 million stg loss this year from a business it paid $462 million for in 1994.  \\\"If it doesn't work, they'll have to close it down. But it might provide a positive return in a couple of years,\\\" said one analyst. Pearson is forecasting a return to profit for Mindscape in late 1997.Pearson's uneven record has long made it potential prey for media rivals keen to pounce on its stellar assets and sell off the rest.Recent newspaper reports suggested BSkyB was lining up a bid but the satellite broadcaster strongly denied them. Media and leisure company Granada and Reed-Elsevier have also been rumoured as possible bidders in recent months.  \\\"You cannot dismiss the idea that BSkyB would be interested in Pearson's television interests as it tries to build up its content,\\\" said Henderson Crosthwaite's Barton.Pearson's television interests include the Thames and Grundy production houses and a stake in Britain's planned fifth terrestrial station.Pearson television supremo Greg Dyke is thought to favour a de-merger of the television businesses. But analysts said such a move would almost certainly prompt a bid for that part of the business from any one of BSkyB, Granada, Carlton Communications or United News &amp; Media.-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Yes,\\\" said Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch, commenting on 1996 oil production figures.The State Statistics Committee said Russia's 1996 crude oil output fell two percent on 1995 levels to 293 million tonnes (around 5.86 million barrels per day).That is Russia's lowest crude oil output rate in nearly three decades.But the decline is the smallest since Russia -- still the world's third-largest oil producer -- discovered its huge West Siberian reserves and pushed oil output to a peak 570 million tonnes (11.4 million bpd) in 1987.The story has been a downhill one ever since, and double-digit percentage output declines throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s have left Russia's 1996 output at a meagre 51 percent of 1987's record level.But the picture, as the 1996 data shows, is getting prettier.\\\"The fall is finally coming to an end,\\\" said Stephen O'Sullivan, associate director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London. \\\"It's not just a flash in the pan like LUKoil -- it's clearly more broad-based.\\\"Analysts say the recovery showed its first real signs in the second quarter of 1996, possibly as Russian producers began to cash in on a world oil price rally and jammed export outlets.But not all analysts were as sanguine about 1996's results.\\\"The fact that it almost levelled out this year is significant,\\\" said a U.S. oil executive involved in the Petroleum Advisory Forum, a Moscow lobby of foreign oil majors.\\\"But I don't really think it means a whole lot, because there's a problem with domestic demand and with export capacity. It doesn't make sense for producers to produce as much as they can right now.\\\"Russia's oil firms have limited export options and other domestic industries are recovering more slowly.Russian gross domestic product fell by six percent in 1996 and industrial output shrank in every sector of the economy to plunge five percent overall, official figures showed.Declining domestic demand spurred Russian exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States to rise by five percent in the first 11 months of 1996 to 92.8 million tonnes.But analysts say Russia's increasingly hungry tax-man has eaten up a large portion of the extra export earnings, leaving Russia's newly-privatised companies with little to reinvest.Still, the export boom has spurred Russia's 13 or so vertically-integrated oil companies' appetite for growth, and both Lubash and O'Sullivan said domestic crude oil demand might pick up slightly next year.\\\"Any arrest in decline must be heartening and what we must be looking to see is some growth,\\\" said Martin Cocker, a partner in Ernst &amp; Young's World Energy Group unit in Moscow.But Russia's oil companies, most heading into their third or fourth years as restructured, privatised companies, will have problems in breaking completely free of Russia's economic woes.\\\"It's all a function of when domestic industry turns around,\\\" said the U.S. executive. \\\"Producers and refiners both have an incentive to export and will for quite some time.\\\"\",\n          \"Eli Lilly &amp; Co expects marketing and administration costs in the fourth quarter to be only slightly up or flat versus the year-ago level, marking a slowdown from a third-quarter jump of 6.5 percent.The line item \\\"may be up a couple percent, but certainly below the growth rates we showed in the third quarter,\\\" Lilly chief financial officer Charles Golden said in an interview.Lilly's gross profit margin declined again in the third quarter, partly due to increased marketing costs for launching new products, such as the anti-schizophrenia drug Zyprexa.  Zyprexa is one of a handful of new, higher-margin products that will begin to lift sales in the fourth quarter, but a margin trend turnaround is likely further off, Golden said.\\\"I think it's going to be sometime next year. I'm not sure it's in the next quarter,\\\" Golden said of improved margins.Gross margin has declined for two consecutive quarters.Other than that, analysts greeted Lilly's third-quarter results with a positive tone.\\\"I didn't see any real big surprises in these numbers,\\\" said NatWest Securities drug industry analyst John Lamberton.  Lilly's third-quarter operating profits of $0.64 per share, versus $0.54 per share in 1995, were precisely in line with Wall Street expectations, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Mariola Haggar.The company said an 11-percent sales gain was led by the anti-depressant Prozac, the human insulin Humulin and increased revenues from the PCS Health Systems unit.Shares in Lilly were up 1/2 to 69-1/4 on Tuesday after the Indianapolis-based drugmaker reported an 18-percent gain in third-quarter earnings over the year-ago period.  In the fourth quarter, Golden said, Lilly will likely lose a small benefit to earnings per share stemming from a decline in outstanding shares versus the prior year. That benefit, caused by the split-off of Guidant Corp last year, boosted third-quarter earnings by five percent.\\\"We will lose that in the fourth quarter ... You're talking a penny or two per share,\\\" he said.In the fourth quarter, the company will also lose a small boost to earnings from a lower tax rate that lifted third-quarter earnings slightly compared with the prior year.--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787\",\n          \"Merchant banking and Madame Tussaud's could be deemed surplus to requirements as a new management team at Britain's Pearson Plc mould a media company for the next millennium, analysts said on Wednesday.The Pearson empire contains prize brands such as the Financial Times newspaper and Penguin books but Marjorie Scardino, who will take over as chief executive in January, has said that overall profit performance is inadequate.Analysts say Pearson has yet to complete its 1990s journey from industrial conglomerate to focused media enterprise.  \\\"The definition of their three core business areas -- Information, Education and Entertainment is a little imprecise,\\\" said Mark Beilby of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. \\\"They may have to jettison some high value assets and focus on pinpoint areas.\\\"Analysts cite Anglo-Dutch company Reed Elsevier as an example of a media company which has successfully identified key market areas and built up strong positions in these -- the provision of high-margin business information being Reed's speciality.  They point out that Pearson, with a market capitalisation of around four billion stg, is not a media giant in global terms and that its capital and management time is being too thinly spread under the current structure.Pearson's 50 percent stake in London investment bank Lazard Brothers -- which does not fit into one of the three core business areas -- is seen as a likely candidate for disposal.\\\"At some stage Lazards will go out of the door to make Pearson into more of a genuine media company,\\\" said Louise Barton of Henderson Crosthwaite.  Close boardroom links between Pearson and Lazards could complicate matters. However, analysts say a sale would go a long way towards convincing doubters that Scardino is prepared to shake up the company.The Tussauds Group, which includes London's famous Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum and a number of theme parks, is also seen as peripheral and a drain on resources for a company which could earn richer pickings from television and publishing.U.S. consumer software publisher Mindscape is the most glaring weakness, with Pearson forecasting a 46 million stg loss this year from a business it paid $462 million for in 1994.  \\\"If it doesn't work, they'll have to close it down. But it might provide a positive return in a couple of years,\\\" said one analyst. Pearson is forecasting a return to profit for Mindscape in late 1997.Pearson's uneven record has long made it potential prey for media rivals keen to pounce on its stellar assets and sell off the rest.Recent newspaper reports suggested BSkyB was lining up a bid but the satellite broadcaster strongly denied them. Media and leisure company Granada and Reed-Elsevier have also been rumoured as possible bidders in recent months.  \\\"You cannot dismiss the idea that BSkyB would be interested in Pearson's television interests as it tries to build up its content,\\\" said Henderson Crosthwaite's Barton.Pearson's television interests include the Thames and Grundy production houses and a stake in Britain's planned fifth terrestrial station.Pearson television supremo Greg Dyke is thought to favour a de-merger of the television businesses. But analysts said such a move would almost certainly prompt a bid for that part of the business from any one of BSkyB, Granada, Carlton Communications or United News &amp; Media.-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety.The National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors.The league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org.The site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies.\"Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information,\" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch \"has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy.\"In May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged.Fraud reports from the league's site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities.The second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts.In third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said.Other top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home.The League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.\n",
